# Tic Tac Toe

## Introduction

My take on the Tic Tac Toe project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe) using strictly vanilla CSS and JS. As Tic Tac Toe is a straight-forward game, I used the simplicity of this project as an opporunity to expand my knowledge with both languages with a heavy focus on interesting graphics and toggling element visibility. As an added challenge, I wanted to creativly communicate to players with minimal text (who has time to read rules these days?!). This resulted in choosing appropriate icons and a blinking tile animation for players who may still be lost.
